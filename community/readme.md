These ISO's are supported by someone in the Manjaro community and/or team.

### To download the ISO using a torrent file, just download the file and open it with your Bittorrent client (like Deluge, Transmission etc).

### ISO checksums have been moved from this file, into their own files in the "checksums" folder of each Manjaro edition.
For example, the MATE iso checksum files are located in Home -> community -> MATE -> 15.12 -> checksums.
